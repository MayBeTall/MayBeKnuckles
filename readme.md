# MayBeKnuckles
## A collection of experiments for Valve's Knuckles EV3s
Documention? What's that? I haven't slept and it's 6AM.

### Requirements
Unity 2018
SteamVR Unity Plugin v2.0.1 - [link](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases)


### KnucklePoses
This script allows you to easily detect when the user makes certain poses with their fingers. Finger guns, flipping the bird, spider-man web shooting. It's all possible. Try it tonight! Or... today? I need sleep.

#### The example doesn't work out of the box. You have to go into the [CameraRig] within MayBePlayer and change each of the controllers to use their respective Pose Action.
